                            A bone therapy, also known as bone-setting or osteopathic manipulation, is a therapeutic technique used to manipulate and adjust bones and joints in order to promote healing and alleviate pain. It's often performed by skilled physical therapists.
                            The concept behind bone therapy is that misalignments or restrictions in the bones and joints can lead to discomfort, and pain, and even affect the functioning of surrounding muscles and nerves. By applying specific techniques, practitioners aim to restore proper alignment, mobility, and balance to the musculoskeletalÂ system.
